            <h2>Welcome to War!</h2>
            <p>If you have never played war before, or maybe it's been a while since you have last played, here are the
                rules. To start, the deck is divided evenly to
                both players. Each round both players place a card face up and the player with the higher card put both
                cards in their discard pile. If the cards are
                the same rank, a war occurs. In a war both players place 3 cards face down, then a 4th card face up and
                the player with the high card gets all the cards.
                If a player runs out of cards from their deck, they shuffle their discard pile and keep on playing. The
                game ends when a player has won all 52 cards. Aces are
                high.</p>
            <p>You have the option to play out the game as normal against the computer or if you don't have time, you
                can run the game as a simulation and have the computer
                report who won, how long it would have taken to play, and other stats about the game.</p>
                <p>(This page is currently just a mock-up. It is all hardcoded and the only functionality is showing the welcome screen,
                    clicking on "Start Game" shows the game, and clicking "Give Up" shows the game over screen.)</p>
