# War


## V 0.1 
-Initial code upload. Created the classes for Card and Deck.

## V 0.2
-Trying to figure out which classes should handle the differnet functions of the game like splitting the deck into 2 for the user and computer.
<br>-Created the Game class, moved some of the methods around, created a user and a computer hand within the game method.

## V 0.3
-Still figuring out which classes should handle different parts of the game.
<br>-Created methods to draw 1 card and to take the cards after a player wins the turn.
<br>-Coded some test code in the Main method to have the program play the game on its own, but since war can be super long, I limited it to 500 turns
or else it seems like it goes into an almost infinite loop. When I ran the test without the limit, I let the progrm run for 30 seconds, the number 
of cards in each hand didn't change much, and my laptop's fan started revving up.
<br>-Still need to code a method to draw extra cards when a war happens.
<br>-I want to add user input to draw a card or give up before the game ends. I also would like to get it working in a webpage to demo on my website.
